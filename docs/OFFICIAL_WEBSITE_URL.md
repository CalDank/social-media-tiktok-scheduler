# Official Website URL for TikTok Developer Portal

TikTok Developer Portal asks for an **Official Website URL** (also called "App Website" or "Website URL"). Here's what to use:

---

## 🎯 **Option 1: Use Your Frontend Application URL** ⭐ (Recommended if deployed)

If you've deployed your TikTok scheduler frontend application, use that URL:

### Examples:

**If deployed on:**
- **Vercel**: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
- **Netlify**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`
- **GitHub Pages** (frontend): `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/your-frontend-repo`
- **Custom domain**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- **AWS/Cloud hosting**: Your production URL

### Best Option:
Use the URL where users actually access and use your TikTok scheduler application.

---

## 🎯 **Option 2: Use GitHub Pages Legal Docs Homepage** (If app not deployed yet)

If your frontend isn't deployed yet, you can use your legal documents homepage:

```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/social-media-tiktok-scheduler/
```

This will show the `index.md` page with links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

**Note:** This is a temporary solution. Update to your actual app URL once deployed.

---

## 🎯 **Option 3: Use Your GitHub Repository URL** (Temporary)

If neither of the above are available, you can temporarily use:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/social-media-tiktok-scheduler
```

**Note:** This is not ideal, but TikTok will accept it. Update it later when you have a proper website.
